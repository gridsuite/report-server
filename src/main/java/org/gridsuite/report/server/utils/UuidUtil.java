    /**
    * Create a uuidv7 generator that will generate all uuids for the same root report's children (not for the root report it self which stills in uuidv4).
    * The generator is created per root report to avoid having similar uuids for unrelated reports which would be surprising to people looking at the ids.
    * NOTE: The uuids would be similar because we generate incremented uuids when generating many uuids during the same millisecond,
    * and we observe that currently we dogenerate up to ~500 report entities in the same millisecond.
    * So for a given root report, we have monotonicity because:
    * - in the same milisecond, the ids will be incremented starting from the random value.
    * - in separate miliseconds, the random value will reset possibly to a smaller value, but the millisecond is greater and the milliseconds comes first.
    * Performance gains:
    *   - With the millisecond prefix, we already remove almost all problems of having many Full Page Images (FPIs) in the PostgreSQL WAL (the FPI come from the index pages, where a new random uuid would have been inserted in the index in a different page virtually every time).
    *   - With the submillisecond part, there are three options:
    *       1. milliseconds + full random (most random, worst sequential writes)
    *       2. milliseconds + submillisecond counter + random (what PostgreSQL gen_uuid_v7() does)
    *       3. milliseconds + random seed then monotonic counter (what timeBasedEpochGenerator does : our choice)
    *     We picked option 3 both for the sequential write performance gain and because it matches the nature of order_:
    *     within a root report, order_ is a strictly increasing integer, and so is the submillisecond part of our UUIDs.
    *     This makes the generated UUID v7 a closer approximation of what the composite id (rootNodeId + order_) would give us natively.
    * NOTE: We currently use PostgreSQL 17, which does not support uuid v7 natively (gen_uuidv7() was only introduced in PostgreSQL 18).
    * This is not a problem because uuid v7 generation happens entirely in Java
    * PostgreSQL only stores the resulting value as a standard UUID column (it does not care about the uuid version, it treats all UUIDs as 128-bit values.)
    * NOTE: with this approach no data migration is needed since uuid v7 is stored as a plain UUID column (fully compatible with existing uuid v4 rows).
    * we kept the UUID alongside order_ because it is simpler for now than switching to a composite id (rootNodeId + order_) which would be a breaking API change.
    * => this is a technical debt: the composite id (rootNodeId + order_) is the right approach
    * It would permanently solve the WAL bloat at the source: child nodes already have a sequential order_ that uniquely identifies them within a root report,
    * so (rootNodeId, order_) would be a naturally sequential primary key, UUID v7 here is only a mitigation, not a structural fix.
